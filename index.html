      <p>
        At a time when rock music was evolving away from the forces that had
        made it possible in the first place, Creedence Clearwater Revival
        brought rock back to its roots with a concise synthesis of rockabilly,
        swamp pop, R&B, and country. Although the band's tight, punchy
        arrangements were a group effort, their vision belonged to singer,
        songwriter, guitarist, and leader John Fogerty. Fogerty's classic
        compositions for Creedence evoked enduring images of Americana, and they
        simultaneously reflected burning social issues of the day. The band's
        genius was their ability to accomplish this with the economic, primal
        power of a classic rockabilly ensemble.
